# **🧩 Offline Reinforcement Learning**

Learning from the past, without interacting with the future.

This repository is a complete collection of Offline Reinforcement Learning (Offline RL) algorithms, built fully from scratch in PyTorch and Jupyter Notebooks.
It contains implementations of both classic baselines and modern sequence-model approaches, providing a practical playground to understand and experiment with the field.

## **🚀 What is Offline RL?**

Reinforcement Learning (RL) traditionally requires an agent to interact with an environment to learn. But in many real-world settings (e.g., robotics, healthcare, recommendation systems, self-driving), interactions are expensive, unsafe, or outright impossible.

This is where Offline RL comes in:

    The agent learns entirely from a fixed dataset of past experiences.
    
    No new environment interactions are required.
    
    Algorithms must carefully balance exploitation of the dataset with avoiding distributional shift errors.

Think of it as:

    “Teaching an agent to drive, only by showing it recorded driving logs — no steering wheel in its hands.”

## **📦 What’s Inside**

This repo currently includes:

**Behavior Cloning (BC) 🐣**

    The simplest baseline — pure supervised learning on state → action pairs.

**TD3 + BC ⚡**

    Combines offline policy learning with a regularized actor-critic backbone.

**Implicit Q-Learning (IQL) 🔎**

    A value-based approach that avoids importance sampling and instability.

**Conservative Q-Learning (CQL) 🛡️**

    Penalizes overestimation by pushing down unseen Q-values, making it safer for deployment.

**Decision Transformer (DT) 🤖✨**

    A sequence-model approach: re-frames RL as a conditional sequence prediction task, using transformer architectures.

### **🌍 Why This Matters**

Offline RL is a critical step towards real-world AI:

    🌱 Safer learning when exploration is risky (robots, medicine).
    
    🎮 Works with large datasets (games, logs, simulations).
    
    📈 Bridges supervised learning and reinforcement learning through clever algorithms.
    
    🧠 Opens the door for foundation models in RL (like Decision Transformer, Trajectory Transformer, Decision Diffuser).

This repo is not just code — it’s a roadmap of Offline RL evolution, from the simplest BC baseline all the way to cutting-edge sequence-based RL.
